# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of The School District Analysis:
The purpose of this school district analysis was to go through a multi school data set that included gradings from 15 schools in math and reading for grades 9 to 12. The analysis calculated the means of each math and reading mark per grade and per school. The 9th grade grades were removed for Thomas High School which greatly improved their performance relative to other schools. This was completed by using Panda to code on Jupyter Notebook.
